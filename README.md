👋 Hello, I'm Kelvin, a seasoned Biomedical Equipment Technician with a decade of experience at DaVita Kidney Care in Florida.

🚀 Recently, I've ventured into the coding world, focusing on Swift, Apple's programming language. Despite no prior computer science background, I've dedicated daily study sessions and completed courses at Ohio State University and Miami-Dade College through an Apple-sponsored grant.

🌐 Engaging with the Swift.org community, I discovered the 2023 Swift Mentorship Program. Under the mentorship of Holly Borla, Swift Language Engineering Manager at Apple, I've gained valuable insights and certifications, including a credential as a Swift Associate.

💡 My goal is to leverage my biomedical expertise and coding skills to develop innovative apps for the hemodialysis industry. Check out my [Swift Associate Credential](https://www.credly.com/badges/7709ccba-5f02-4c16-a54a-6d1932088e61/linked_in?t=s2f7lg), and stay tuned for the biomedical Buddy app currently in production.

📱 Excited about the intersection of healthcare and technology, I'm on a journey to become a proficient iOS developer, exploring opportunities to integrate coding skills into my role at DaVita.
